Type theory arose as a foundational response to contradictions in early set theory and evolved into a unifying language for logic, mathematics, and programming. In the early 1900s Bertrand Russell introduced a hierarchy of *types* to prevent self-referential paradoxes in naïve set theory[\[1\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20types%20was,of%20Cantor%20that%20no%20mapping). Russell's *ramified* types (1908; *Principia Mathematica* 1910--13) stratified mathematical objects into levels so that no set could contain itself. Building on Russell, Alonzo Church's **Simple Theory of Types** (1940) recast types using the λ-calculus. Church's system treated types as primitive and allowed function types between any types, making a simpler, more general formulation than Russell's (reusing λ-notation as the only binding)[\[2\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-church/#:~:text=Church%E2%80%99s%20type%20theory%20is%20a,in%20a%20way%20so%20that). This "Church-style" theory eliminated paradoxes by construction: a term of one type can never be interpreted as belonging to an unrelated type. In effect, type theory blocks the classic paradoxes by forbidding illicit self-reference[\[1\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20types%20was,of%20Cantor%20that%20no%20mapping).

## 1. Curry--Howard and the Typed λ-Calculus (1950s--1970s)

In the mid-20th century, researchers discovered that typed λ-calculi serve as programming languages for logic. Haskell Curry observed that the rules for constructing proofs in intuitionistic logic mirror the rules for typing λ-terms. William Howard (1969--1980) made this precise: *propositions as types, proofs as programs*. Under the **Curry--Howard correspondence**, an intuitionistic proof of a proposition corresponds to a λ-term of the same type, and normalizing the proof corresponds to running the program[\[3\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic/#:~:text=the%20Curry,In%20intuitionistic%20type%20theory%20this). In other words, checking a proof is like type-checking a program, and executing a proof as a program yields its *witness*. This insight bridged formal logic and computation: functional programming languages inherently enforce logical discipline, and program execution is proof normalization[\[3\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic/#:~:text=the%20Curry,In%20intuitionistic%20type%20theory%20this)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_closed_category#:~:text=currying%3B%20it%20has%20led%20to,in%20any%20Cartesian%20closed%20category).

Meanwhile, **polymorphism** expanded typed λ-calculus. Jean-Yves Girard (1972) and John C. Reynolds (1974) independently introduced the **polymorphic λ-calculus** (System F). System F adds universal quantification over types, allowing functions that work uniformly for *all* types. For example, the polymorphic identity function has type \$\\forall X.\\,X\\to X\$ regardless of \$X\$[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_F#:~:text=System%20F%20,Reynolds). This impredicative feature turned out to be powerful but delicate: Girard later showed that an unstratified "type of all types" leads to inconsistency (the *Girard paradox*), prompting later systems to use a hierarchy of type-universes to stay consistent[\[6\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic/#:~:text=Martin,be%20encoded%20in%20this%20theory).

At the same time, practical type inference was advancing. Roger Hindley (1969) and Robin Milner (1978) developed what is now called the **Hindley--Milner** type system. It equips polymorphic λ-calculus with a complete type-inference algorithm (Milner's *Algorithm W*) that finds the most general type of any expression without annotations[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#:~:text=The%20origin%20is%20the%20type,support%20systems%20with%20polymorphic%20references). This made static typing practical: languages like ML and Haskell could infer types automatically, yet still guarantee uniform "parametric" behavior. John Reynolds' **parametricity** theorem showed that any function of a given polymorphic type must behave uniformly for all instantiations of its type parameters. Philip Wadler dubbed the resulting corollaries "free theorems" (1989): valuable properties deduced from types alone. These meta-theorems about programs (e.g. any `∀α. List<α>→List<α>` function must be some combination of list rewrites) have become an important outcome of the typed paradigm, aiding reasoning and optimization.

## 2. Dependent Types and Constructive Foundations (1970s--1980s)

In the 1970s Per Martin-Löf introduced **Intuitionistic Type Theory** (ITT), a fully *dependent* type theory for constructive mathematics. Unlike simple types, a *dependent type* can depend on a value (e.g. the type "vector of length *n*"). Martin-Löf's system combined the Curry--Howard view with a rich universe of types and inductive definitions, aiming to serve as a foundation of constructive math where proofs are executable programs. In this setting, proving a theorem is the same as writing a program of a suitable dependent type. The famous 1982 lecture "Constructive mathematics and computer programming" emphasizes that proof assistants directly implement this ideas. Martin-Löf's original 1971 theory had a universe of all types, but Girard's paradox showed that this was inconsistent. Martin-Löf adjusted his theory to use a predicative hierarchy of universes (𝕌₀:𝕌₁:...), each closed under the usual type constructors[\[6\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic/#:~:text=Martin,be%20encoded%20in%20this%20theory).

This *Martin-Löf Type Theory* (MLTT) introduced many concepts now standard in dependent type systems: the distinction between types and terms, dependent function (Π) and pair (Σ) types, an identity type for equalities, and support for inductive types (natural numbers, trees, etc.). Intuitionistic type theory allows us to represent logical quantifiers as type constructors and to attach computational content to proofs. For example, a proof of a statement ∀*n*,*m*. *P(n,m)* is a function that, given specific numbers *n* and *m*, produces a witness of *P(n,m)*[\[8\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic/#:~:text=%2B%20r%2Cn%29%20). In MLTT one can *extract* certified algorithms from constructive proofs automatically. The Martin-Löf system (sometimes with minor variations) forms the basis of proof assistants like Agda, Coq's core theory, and others, embodying the idea that "proofs are programs". As one authority notes, Martin-Löf's type theory **"further extends the simply-typed lambda calculus with dependent types"**[\[9\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic/#:~:text=Russell%20developed%20type%20theory%20,tuples%20indexed%20by%20%5C%28n), capturing data-dependent invariants that ordinary types cannot.

## 3. Proof Assistants and the Calculus of Constructions (1980s--1990s)

The late 20th century saw type theory become the backbone of interactive theorem proving. One pioneering system was **AUTOMATH** (de Bruijn, 1967--1972), designed to check complete mathematical proofs. Automath used a form of dependent type theory long before Martin-Löf, including *categories* (sets) of proofs and a "proofs-as-objects" approach resembling Curry--Howard[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automath#:~:text=The%20Automath%20system%20included%20many,1). Automath introduced de Bruijn indices and a strict type discipline, and it had dependent types from the start[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automath#:~:text=The%20Automath%20system%20included%20many,1). Although Automath was not widely used, it influenced later systems and proof frameworks[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automath#:~:text=Automath%20was%20never%20widely%20publicized,use%2C%20was%20influenced%20by%20Automath).

A more direct ancestor of modern systems is the **Calculus of Constructions** (CoC, Coquand & Huet 1988). CoC is a powerful higher-order typed λ-calculus that unifies MLTT-style dependent types with the impredicative features of Church's logic. Every construct in logic or computation (functions, types, proofs) is treated uniformly as a λ-term. CoC served as the logical core of the Coq proof assistant; adding inductive types yields the **Calculus of Inductive Constructions** (CIC), the formal foundation of Coq. As the Wikipedia entry notes, CoC was *"created by Thierry Coquand"* and serves as both a programming language and a constructive foundation for mathematics. It is "the basis for Coq and other proof assistants"[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_constructions#:~:text=Type%20theory%20created%20by%20Thierry,Coquand). Starting in the 1990s, Coq (and related systems like Matita and Lean) matured into industrial-strength tools for formal proof development.

Other ecosystems sprang up: Agda and Idris adopt a pure Martin-Löf-style type theory, focusing on dependently-typed programming. Lean (first released 2013) and Isabelle/HOL (earlier, based on higher-order logic) offer rich libraries and automation. HOL Light uses simply-typed higher-order logic. Though details differ, all leverage a strict type discipline to ensure correctness and expressivity. A useful unifying perspective is Barendregt's *lambda cube* and Pure Type System framework, which organizes various typed λ-calculi (simple types, System F, dependently typed, etc.) as points in a three-dimensional cube. In practice, mainstream proof assistants rely on these developments under the hood: for example, the Lean and Coq kernels implement variants of CIC, while Agda implements a variant of MLTT.

## 4. Impact on Mathematics and Software

Type-theoretic proof assistants have enabled new styles of theorem-proving and software verification with unprecedented rigor.

-   **Mathematics.** Machine-checked proofs of deep theorems became feasible. For example, Georges Gonthier's team formalized the Four-Color Theorem in Coq (completed 2005, published 2008) and later the Feit--Thompson *Odd Order* Theorem (\~2012)[\[13\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic/#:~:text=Variants%20of%20intuitionistic%20type%20theory,and%20other%20computer%20software). These human-scale proofs (hundreds of pages) were completely reconstructed as programs in Coq, checked down to the atomic inferences. (As one account notes, Gonthier's approach was to turn "every mathematical concept into a data structure or a program," making the entire proof an exercise in program verification[\[13\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic/#:~:text=Variants%20of%20intuitionistic%20type%20theory,and%20other%20computer%20software).) The main results (e.g. "every planar graph is 4-colorable") did not change, but the *process* did: these projects coordinated large teams, ensured no detail was omitted, and made the proofs fully reproducible. In another domain, homotopy type theory (HoTT) -- following Voevodsky's Univalent Foundations -- has produced new proofs by treating types as spaces and identifying isomorphic structures. For instance, the fundamental group of the circle (π₁(S¹) ≅ ℤ) can be computed *synthetically* in HoTT, using higher-inductive types and the Univalence Axiom. Univalence posits that equivalences (e.g. bijections or isomorphisms) between types are themselves equalities[\[14\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/#:~:text=%5C%5B%20%5Ctext). This blurs the traditional distinction between "same structure" and "same set," formalizing the mathematician's practice of working "up to isomorphism." (Cubical type theory gives Univalence a computational content, so these equivalences can actually be executed.) Beyond specific theorems, the correspondence between type theory and category theory is now standard: simply-typed λ-calculus corresponds to Cartesian closed categories[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_closed_category#:~:text=currying%3B%20it%20has%20led%20to,in%20any%20Cartesian%20closed%20category), and more general dependent theories to *locally* Cartesian closed categories and toposes. Lawvere's elementary theory of the category of sets (ETCS, 1964) is a categorical axiomatization of sets, complementing the type-theoretic viewpoint[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_theory_of_the_category_of_sets#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20elementary%20theory,without%20references%20to%20category%20theory).

-   **Software.** Type theory has enabled **verified systems** that would be practically impossible to certify by testing alone. *CompCert* is a flagship example: it is a full C compiler written in Coq, with a machine-checked proof that the assembly code it emits preserves the semantics of the source C program[\[16\]](https://xavierleroy.org/publi/erts2016_compcert.pdf#:~:text=CompCert%20is%20the%20first%20commercially,practical%20experience%20and%20give%20an). In other words, *no* undefined compiler bug can turn correct code into incorrect machine code. The 2016 report by Leroy et al. proclaims: *"CompCert is the first commercially available optimizing compiler that is formally verified"*, and that compiled code is *proved to behave exactly as specified*[\[16\]](https://xavierleroy.org/publi/erts2016_compcert.pdf#:~:text=CompCert%20is%20the%20first%20commercially,practical%20experience%20and%20give%20an). Similarly, the seL4 microkernel (first released 2009) was fully verified: it became *"the world's first OS kernel with a machine-checked functional correctness proof at the source-code level"*[\[17\]](https://sel4.systems/About/seL4-whitepaper.pdf#:~:text=seL4%E2%80%99s%20Verification%20Story%20In%202009%2C,proof%20was%20200%2C000%20lines%20of). This means every assembly instruction of the kernel was shown to faithfully implement its abstract spec. The proof even extends to security properties by refinement. More recent efforts include the Project Everest cryptography initiative: using the F\* dependently-typed language, researchers built EverCrypt, a high-performance crypto library (used in TLS) with end-to-end proofs of functional correctness and memory safety[\[18\]](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/evercrypt-a-fast-veri%EF%AC%81ed-cross-platform-cryptographic-provider/#:~:text=We%20present%20EverCrypt%3A%20a%20comprehensive,of%20these%20techniques%20with%20new). These projects showcase guarantees unique to formal verification: whole compilers and kernels with machine-checked correctness proofs, and cryptographic implementations whose behavior is guaranteed by proof, not just by empirical testing. In sum, dependent types and proof assistants have enabled building infrastructure whose trustworthiness far exceeds what was previously feasible.

## 5. Compact Timeline of Key Developments

-   **1908--1913:** Russell's ramified type theory; *Principia Mathematica* establishes a typed foundation to avoid paradoxes[\[1\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20types%20was,of%20Cantor%20that%20no%20mapping).
-   **1934--1980:** Curry--Howard correspondence discovered (Curry 1934; Howard 1969); Howard's 1980 note formalizes *proofs-as-programs*[\[3\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic/#:~:text=the%20Curry,In%20intuitionistic%20type%20theory%20this).
-   **1940:** Alonzo Church's *Simple Theory of Types* (STT) and typed λ-calculus, simplifying Russell's system[\[2\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-church/#:~:text=Church%E2%80%99s%20type%20theory%20is%20a,in%20a%20way%20so%20that).
-   **1972--1974:** Independent invention of polymorphic λ-calculus (System F) by Girard (1972) and Reynolds (1974)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_F#:~:text=System%20F%20,Reynolds); Girard's paradox shows need for stratified universes[\[6\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic/#:~:text=Martin,be%20encoded%20in%20this%20theory). Also, Milner (1978) formalizes Hindley's type inference (Algorithm W) for polymorphic ML[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#:~:text=The%20origin%20is%20the%20type,support%20systems%20with%20polymorphic%20references).
-   **1971--1984:** Martin-Löf introduces intuitionistic (dependent) type theory (first version 1971, revised 1982), with Π/Σ types and inductive definitions. After Girard's paradox, a hierarchy of universes is adopted (Martin-Löf 1975)[\[6\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic/#:~:text=Martin,be%20encoded%20in%20this%20theory).
-   **Late 1960s--1970s:** De Bruijn's *AUTOMATH* project pioneers machine-checked mathematics with a type-theoretic language[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automath#:~:text=The%20Automath%20system%20included%20many,1).
-   **1986--1988:** Coquand & Huet define the *Calculus of Constructions* (CoC), later extended with inductive types (CIC) -- the basis for Coq[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_constructions#:~:text=Type%20theory%20created%20by%20Thierry,Coquand).
-   **1990s--2000s:** The λ-cube/Pure Type Systems framework categorizes type theories; proof assistants (Coq, Agda, Isabelle/HOL, etc.) mature with large libraries.
-   **2005--2013:** Landmark computer-checked proofs: Four-Color Theorem (Coq, 2005) and Feit--Thompson Odd-Order Theorem (Coq, 2012)[\[13\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic/#:~:text=Variants%20of%20intuitionistic%20type%20theory,and%20other%20computer%20software). Verified software projects like CompCert (verified C compiler) and seL4 (microkernel) are completed.
-   **2013--Present:** Emergence of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) and the 2013 *HoTT Book* (Univalent Foundations). Cubical Type Theory (2018) gives computational content to univalence. New proof assistants and languages (Lean, F\*, Idris) grow, and formalization effort expands across mathematics and systems.

## 6. Problems Addressed by Type Theory

Type theory was designed to solve several fundamental issues:

-   **Foundational consistency:** By stratifying entities into types, type theory blocks paradoxes like Russell's. No term can be both a set of itself and an element of itself, so contradictions cannot form by construction[\[1\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20types%20was,of%20Cantor%20that%20no%20mapping).
-   **Constructive mathematics (proofs-as-programs):** It aligns logic with computation. In constructive type theories (e.g. MLTT), every proof is a program. Thus one can *extract* verified algorithms from proofs. For example, proving ∀n. *P(n)* means building a function that, given *n*, computes evidence of *P(n)*. This "propositions as types" view means logic directly models computation[\[8\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic/#:~:text=%2B%20r%2Cn%29%20).
-   **Logic--computation correspondence:** The Curry--Howard insight explains why typed functional programming enforces logical rules. A well-typed λ-calculus term is a proof in logic; evaluating the term is proof normalization. This correspondence lets us carry logical reasoning into programming (and vice versa)[\[3\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic/#:~:text=the%20Curry,In%20intuitionistic%20type%20theory%20this).
-   **Expressive, safe abstraction:** Advanced type systems (System F, ML polymorphism) let us write generic, reusable code with automatic type safety. Parametric polymorphism guarantees uniform behavior ("free theorems"). Dependent types go further: they let types depend on values, capturing invariants in the type itself (e.g. vectors of length *n*, balanced trees of height *h*, protocols with payload size *n*). These expressive types encode correctness constraints that the compiler then enforces.
-   **Scalable formal verification:** Proof assistants based on type theory make it practical to check enormous proofs end-to-end. They also allow verifying real software systems: for instance, entire compilers, kernels, or crypto libraries with full machine-checked correctness. These are guarantees essentially impossible to achieve by traditional testing. (CompCert's proof of semantic preservation and seL4's proof of kernel correctness are prime examples.)
-   **New mathematical frameworks:** Extensions like univalence and higher-inductive types enable novel reasoning. The Univalence Axiom, for example, identifies isomorphic structures as equal[\[14\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/#:~:text=%5C%5B%20%5Ctext), supporting working "up to equivalence." This changes how we formulate and prove theorems in fields like homotopy theory and algebraic topology, sometimes simplifying proofs by letting us carry structure across isomorphisms automatically.

## 7. Truly Novel Outcomes of Type Theory

Type theory has produced results not attainable (or not envisaged) in traditional frameworks:

-   **Synthetic mathematics with new axioms:** In Homotopy Type Theory, one assumes Voevodsky's *univalence* and uses *higher inductive types*. This lets us do homotopy-theoretic calculations internally: e.g. one can *compute* the fundamental group of the circle within type theory, obtaining ℤ as expected, but via very different (and often simpler) means than classical topology. The language of HoTT makes equivalences equal by default[\[14\]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory/#:~:text=%5C%5B%20%5Ctext), enabling proofs that are "invariant-by-design." Cubical type theory even lets these principles be computed in code, opening new ways to mechanize homotopy.
-   **Parametricity "free theorems":** From a polymorphic type alone, one derives semantic guarantees. For example, any function of type `forall X. X->X` must be the identity function on each input, because it cannot inspect the value (only create a new one of the same arbitrary type). These theorems (Wadler's "theorems for free") were first noted in type theory and are hard to replicate outside it.
-   **Machine-checked mega-proof projects:** Formal proofs like the Four-Color or Feit--Thompson theorems did not change mathematical truth, but they changed practice. Completing a 255-page proof in Coq required unifying scattered results, digitizing lemmas, and ensuring absolute rigor. The existence of such proofs, and the techniques developed, is a result unique to the type-theoretic approach. Similarly, verified software systems (CompCert, seL4, Everest/EverCrypt) are new artifacts: software with formal proof of correctness from specification to executable code. These deliver confidence and guarantees well beyond what informal or empirical methods could.

## 8. Flavors of Type Theory and Their Uses

-   **Simple (non-dependent) types:** The original (Church 1940) theory with basic types and arrow types. It underlies higher-order logic (HOL) and languages like ML (without dependent types). It suffices for specifying many mathematical and program properties at a high level.
-   **System F (Girard/Reynolds):** Adds impredicative polymorphism (type quantifiers). This is the formal setting for parametric polymorphism in languages like Haskell and ML. System F itself is foundational for studying generic programs and proving properties like normalization.
-   **Dependent Type Theory (Martin-Löf):** Every proposition is a type, and types can depend on values. This is the basis of Agda, Idris, and the core of Coq/Lean. It's powerful enough to express precise specifications (e.g. a sorting algorithm of type "list *n* → list *n* sorted") and to extract verified programs.
-   **Calculus of (Inductive) Constructions:** Coq and Lean's theoretical core. This is essentially an impredicative dependent type theory (CIC) with inductive types for data. It can express rich mathematics and serve as a programming language (Gallina in Coq).
-   **Lambda cube / Pure Type Systems:** A taxonomy of type theories parameterized by rules for type formation (e.g. enabling dependent types, polymorphism, etc.). It shows how various systems (simply-typed, System F, dependently-typed, etc.) relate to each other.
-   **Homotopy/Univalent Type Theories:** Recent extensions of dependent type theory. HoTT adds Voevodsky's Univalence Axiom and higher-inductive types, enabling reasoning about "spaces" within type theory. *Cubical type theory* (2018) reformulates HoTT so that univalence and higher paths are *computational*, which allows implementations to compute with homotopical data.

## 9. Type Theory, Set Theory, and Category Theory

Type theory and set theory are complementary foundations. Classical mathematics typically uses ZFC set theory, but type theory offers an alternative that is more constructive and computational by nature. One can interpret types as sets (e.g. a type \$A\$ as a set of elements), recovering a model of much of set theory. Conversely, category theory provides semantics for type theories: *Cartesian closed categories* give models of simply-typed λ-calculus (the Curry--Howard--Lambek correspondence shows a deep equivalence between intuitionistic logic, typed λ-calculus, and CCCs)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_closed_category#:~:text=currying%3B%20it%20has%20led%20to,in%20any%20Cartesian%20closed%20category). Lawvere's **Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets** (1964) axiomatizes set theory via categorical properties of Set, illustrating a *structural* approach to sets[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_theory_of_the_category_of_sets#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20elementary%20theory,without%20references%20to%20category%20theory). In modern foundations, one often moves seamlessly between these views: for instance, a simple type theory can be seen as the internal language of a topos, while set theory can be modeled in a dependent type theory via cumulative universes. Category theory sits above both as the language of structure: it tells us when type-theoretic constructions correspond to algebraic or topological intuitions (e.g. in HoTT, types behave like spaces and equalities like paths).

## 10. Today's Landscape and Outlook

Type theory continues to evolve rapidly. Current research topics include Homotopy Type Theory and higher categories in type theory (studying ∞-groupoids of proofs), cubical and other constructive models of univalence, observational type theory (for better equality reasoning), and automation (powerful tactics, SMT integration, meta-programming). On the practical side, proof assistants and dependently-typed languages (Coq, Lean, Agda, F\*, Idris, Isabelle/HOL, etc.) are used across disciplines: formalizing mathematics (number theory, algebra, topology) and verifying software (compilers, cryptography, hardware, distributed protocols) at industrial scales. We now see verified TCP/IP stacks, certified machine learning kernels, blockchain smart contracts checked by proofs -- all thanks to type-theoretic tools.

**Big picture:** Types bring syntax, semantics, and computation together. In type theory, proofs are programs and logical consistency is built into the very syntax. This integration has unlocked new mathematics (working "up to equivalence" in HoTT) and unprecedented software assurance (machine-checked compilers and kernels). In the decades since Russell first sliced the world of sets into types, type theory has grown from a paradox-fixer to a rich toolkit for formal reasoning in both math and code.

**Sources:** Historical and technical details are drawn from authoritative overviews and primary works. See, for example, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entries on type theory, Church's type theory, and intuitionistic type theory; original papers by Church (1940), Howard (1980), Girard (1972), Martin-Löf (1972--1984); and accounts of Coq/HoTT development (e.g. *HoTT Book*, conference papers, and verified project reports).
