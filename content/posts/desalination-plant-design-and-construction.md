**Executive Summary:** Desalination is rapidly growing to meet freshwater shortages, especially in arid regions. Modern desalination is dominated by membrane processes (chiefly reverse osmosis, RO) which now account for \>80% of global capacity[\[1\]](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/wired-for-water-how-electrification-is-transforming-desalination#:~:text=The%20last%20major%20new%20thermal,consumption%20for%20desalination%20since%202010), though thermal methods (MSF/MED) remain important in integrated power–water plants. This report presents a comprehensive guide for a desalination plant builder, covering historical development, physical principles, technologies, design components, example calculations, environmental and regulatory considerations, procurement and costing, operations, and emerging trends. Desalination uses either heat or pressure to overcome the osmotic pressure of saline feedwater. For example, SWRO typically requires 40–80 bar feed pressure (∼6,000–8,000 kPa) to overcome ~26 bar osmotic pressure, using modern membranes and energy recovery to achieve ~2.5–6 kWh/m³ energy use[\[2\]](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/wired-for-water-how-electrification-is-transforming-desalination#:~:text=Thermal%20plants%20are%20highly%20energy,full%20car%20tank%20of%20gas)[\[3\]](https://www.desware.net/energy-requirements-desalination-processes.aspx#:~:text=100%20,to%207%20with%20Boron%20treatment). Thermal processes (MSF/MED) require large heat input (e.g. ~11–28 kWh/m³ equivalent[\[3\]](https://www.desware.net/energy-requirements-desalination-processes.aspx#:~:text=100%20,to%207%20with%20Boron%20treatment), roughly an order of magnitude more than RO) and are used where waste heat or low-cost steam is available.

Key metrics: current global capacity ~95 million m³/d in ~15,900 plants (48% in Middle East)[\[4\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329476006_The_state_of_desalination_and_brine_production_A_global_outlook#:~:text=desalination%20data%20suggests%20that%20there,Improved%20brine), producing ~142 million m³/d of hypersaline brine (∼1.5–2× seawater salinity)[\[5\]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329476006_The_state_of_desalination_and_brine_production_A_global_outlook#:~:text=hypersaline%20concentrate%20,Improved%20brine)[\[6\]](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/five-things-know-about-desalination#:~:text=3,support%C2%A0%2050%20Sustainable%20Development%20Goal). Typical RO plants recover ~40–50% (seawater) or 70–90% (brackish) of feed, while thermal plants recover ~40–60%. Large plants (\>500,000 m³/d) achieve production costs \<US\$0.50/m³[\[7\]](https://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/migrated_files/documents/atoms/files/eyl-mazzega_cassignol_desalination_us_2022.pdf#:~:text=ranges%20from%20%240,25%2Fm3%20for%20smaller%20plants) (capex ~\$650–1200 per m³/d capacity[\[8\]](https://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/migrated_files/documents/atoms/files/eyl-mazzega_cassignol_desalination_us_2022.pdf#:~:text=The%20CAPEX%20,as%20much%20energy%2C%20reducing%20OPEX)); small plants cost \>\$1/m³. The largest plants (e.g. Saudi Ras Al-Khair, UAE Taweelah) now exceed 1,000,000 m³/d, often co-located with power generation[\[9\]](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/wired-for-water-how-electrification-is-transforming-desalination#:~:text=The%20size%20of%20desalination%20projects,plant%20and%20reopened%20in%202025).

This guide covers the full design and construction cycle. **Historical development** traces early evaporation to 17th-century work (Aristotle’s *Meteorologica* noted that condensed steam from seawater is fresh[\[10\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=400%20BC%E2%80%93300%20BC%20In%20his,8%20%5D%20Yemen)) through 19th-century distillation patents (first patent 1869 UK[\[11\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=membranes.,distillation%20plant%20is%20built%20in)) and first large plants (Aden 1869, Curaçao 1928[\[12\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=membranes.,Netherlands%20Antilles)). Mid-20th-century breakthroughs include: early MED plants in the 1950s, Robert Silver’s patent on multi-stage flash (MSF) in 1957[\[13\]](http://www.desware.net/sample-chapters/d01/d01-006.pdf#:~:text=Dr,finally%20granted%20in%20March%201960), and the first RO membranes in 1959–1960. Samuel Yuster, Sidney Loeb and Srinivasa Sourirajan (UCLA) produced the first practical asymmetric cellulose-acetate RO membrane in 1959–60[\[14\]](https://www.chemeng.ucla.edu/history/#:~:text=UCLA%20made%20a%20significant%20breakthrough,and%20North%20Africa%2C%20where%20desalination)[\[15\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=1960%20Technology%20The%20first%20synthetic,1). The first commercial RO plant (Coalinga, CA, 1965, brackish) and first seawater RO plants (Bermuda 1974, Jeddah 1975) soon followed[\[16\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=developed.,the%20world%27s%20seawater%20desalination%20capacity)[\[17\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=13%20,Saudi%20Arabia). Key inventors/innovators include Loeb and Sourirajan (high-flux RO membranes), Robert Silver (MSF), Rosenthal/Rebhun (MED developments), John Cadotte (1977 thin-film composite membrane) and modern companies (Veolia, IDE, SUEZ, Acciona, Doosan, Abengoa, etc.) which have built thousands of plants worldwide.

**Principles of desalination:** The core challenge is to separate freshwater from salts. Thermodynamically, the *minimum* work for desalting 35,000 mg/L seawater (to 0 mg/L) at typical recovery (~50%) is ~0.86 kWh/m³[\[18\]](https://www.desware.net/energy-requirements-desalination-processes.aspx#:~:text=free%20energy%20between%20the%20incoming,below%20makes%20the%20desired%20comparison). In practice, processes use 3–6 kWh/m³ (RO) or 10–30 kWh/m³ (thermal). **Osmotic pressure** (π) of saltwater is ~26 bar at 25 °C; RO must exceed this (e.g. 60–80 bar) to drive water through the membrane. **Mass balance:** For an RO system, \$\$Q_f = Q_p + Q_c,\quad C_fQ_f = C_pQ_p + C_cQ_c\$\$ where $`Q`$ is flow and $`C`$ concentration (feed, permeate, concentrate). **Recovery (R)** is $`Q_{p}/Q_{f}`$. Thermal processes obey latent heat balance: heat input = water vaporization + losses. **Ion transport:** In electrodialysis (ED/EDR) cations and anions migrate under DC voltage across ion-exchange membranes, desalting the diluate and concentrating brine. **Energy/entropy:** The actual work exceeds the minimum due to irreversibilities (e.g. pumping friction, heat losses). Modern processes employ energy recovery (pressure exchangers, heat integration) to approach theoretical limits.

## Historical Development and Key Innovations

- **Ancient/early history:** Primitive solar stills date to antiquity (Aristotle observed that condensed seawater vapor yields fresh water[\[19\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=400%20BC%E2%80%93300%20BC%20In%20his,8)). Commercial distillation plants appeared in the late 1800s (first British patent 1869[\[11\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=membranes.,distillation%20plant%20is%20built%20in); first public plant, Aden 1869[\[12\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=membranes.,Netherlands%20Antilles); first commercial plant, Malta 1881[\[20\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=the%20Red%20Sea%20port.,distillation%20plant%20is%20built%20in)). In the 1930s–40s, large thermal stills were built in the Caribbean and the Middle East[\[21\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=1881%20Facility%20The%20world%27s%20first,stage%20flash).

- **Thermal processes (MSF/MED/VC):** Multistage flash (MSF) was invented by Dr. Robert Silver in 1957 (patented 1960)[\[13\]](http://www.desware.net/sample-chapters/d01/d01-006.pdf#:~:text=Dr,finally%20granted%20in%20March%201960). The first MSF plant (dual-purpose with power) began operating in the U.S. in 1955[\[22\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=1955%20Technology%20Multi,Breton%20and%20Reid%20demonstrate%20the), and the first dedicated MSF facility (Kuwait) in 1957[\[23\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=1957%20Facility%20The%20first%20multi,University%20of%20California%2C%20made%20from). Multi-effect distillation (MED) emerged in the 1950s as a lower-temperature alternative (first MED plant in Aruba, 1959[\[24\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=1959%20Scientific%20development%20Reverse%20osmosis%3A,University%20of%20California%2C%20made%20from)). Later innovations included low-pressure MED, thermo-compression (thermal vapor compression, TVC), and mechanical vapor compression (MVC) which are widely used today.

- **Membrane desalination:** In 1931 the term “reverse osmosis” was coined and patented, but membranes were only weakly permeable[\[25\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=built%20in%20Aruba.,Saline%20Water%20Act%E2%80%9D%20to%20provide). A breakthrough came in 1959 when Loeb and Sourirajan (UCLA) produced the first high-flux cellulose acetate RO membrane[\[14\]](https://www.chemeng.ucla.edu/history/#:~:text=UCLA%20made%20a%20significant%20breakthrough,and%20North%20Africa%2C%20where%20desalination)[\[15\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=1960%20Technology%20The%20first%20synthetic,1). The first spiral-wound RO module (1963) made large-scale RO feasible[\[26\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=1963%20Scientific%20development%20Loeb%20and,United%20States). By the late 1960s, commercial RO units (brackish water) up to ~8,000 m³/day were operating[\[27\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=1960s%20Membrane%20technologies%20arise%20as,two%20new%20technologies%20capable%20to). Development of thin-film polyamide composite membranes in the 1970s–80s (e.g. Cadotte’s 1977 design[\[28\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=1978%20Technology%20Reverse%20osmosis%3A%20the,13)) dramatically improved SWRO performance. Today, companies like Dow/DuPont, Hydranautics, Toray, and others manufacture advanced RO membranes.

- **Electro-membrane and emerging processes:** Electrodialysis (ED) was commercialized for brackish water in the 1960s[\[29\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=1960,The%20permeabilities%20of%20these%20early) (and later improved via electrodialysis reversal, EDR). Membrane distillation (MD), forward osmosis (FO), capacitive deionization (CDI), and other novel methods have been researched since the 1980s–2000s. These have lower technology readiness; FO and MD are under active development for niche applications (e.g. high-salinity brine polishing or using low-grade heat). Freeze desalination (ice-making) is also proven but rarely used at scale. In recent decades the trend has been overwhelmingly toward RO: membrane plants (RO+EDR) now make up \>60% of capacity in MENA and \>80% globally[\[1\]](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/wired-for-water-how-electrification-is-transforming-desalination#:~:text=The%20last%20major%20new%20thermal,consumption%20for%20desalination%20since%202010), driven by falling energy costs and efficiency gains.

**Figure:** *Timeline of key desalination milestones.* (For detailed chronologies see[\[12\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=membranes.,Netherlands%20Antilles)[\[30\]](https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_water_desalination#:~:text=1959%20Scientific%20development%20Reverse%20osmosis%3A,1).)

## Core Principles (Thermodynamics, Osmosis, Ion Transport)

- **Thermodynamics:** Desalination is fundamentally an energy-intensive separation. The *minimum* work required is set by the Gibbs free energy difference between saline feed and separate streams. For 35,000 mg/L SW at 50% recovery, this minimum is about 0.86 kWh/m³[\[18\]](https://www.desware.net/energy-requirements-desalination-processes.aspx#:~:text=free%20energy%20between%20the%20incoming,below%20makes%20the%20desired%20comparison). Real processes use many times this minimum (typically 5–20×). Thermal methods consume mostly heat; membrane methods consume mostly electricity (for pressurization). Energy efficiency is often expressed via Gain Output Ratio (GOR) for thermal (mass of distillate per mass of steam) or specific energy (kWh/m³) for electrical.

- **Osmotic pressure:** Salts dissolved in water create osmotic pressure (π). The van’t Hoff relation (π ≈ iCRT) gives ~25–30 bar for seawater at ambient temperature. In RO, applied hydraulic pressure must exceed π to drive water from the high-salinity side to the low-salinity side. The pressure required rises with feed salinity and desired recovery (since higher recovery raises concentrate salinity and π). For example, modern SWRO systems often run at 60–80 bar (870–1,160 psi) for ocean water, while brackish RO (1,000–5,000 mg/L) may run at only 15–30 bar (210–430 psi).

- **Ion and molecule transport:** In RO and NF membranes, water molecules dissolve into the membrane and diffuse through (solution-diffusion model), while most ions/salts are rejected. Membrane selectivity results from size exclusion and solution–diffusion differences; advanced thin-film membranes achieve \>99% NaCl rejection at high flux. In ED/EDR, an applied DC voltage causes cations and anions to migrate through respective cation- or anion-exchange membranes, producing a desalinated stream and a concentrated brine stream. Electrodialysis works best for lower-salinity water because energy cost rises sharply with higher ionic concentration (joule heating losses).

- **Mass/Energy Balances:** A generic mass balance for any unit: feed = product + reject (concentrate). For RO, define recovery $`R = Q_{p}/Q_{f}`$. Salt balance: $`C_{f}Q_{f} = C_{p}Q_{p} + C_{b}Q_{b}`$. In energy terms, the main consumption is pressure work: $`W_{\text{pump}} = \frac{Q_{f} \times P}{\eta}`$. E.g. pumping power (kW) = Flow (m³/s) × Pressure (Pa) / (efficiency). Thermally, energy input is latent heat: $`Q_{\text{heat}} = m_{w}\Delta H_{\text{vap}}`$. Energy recovery reduces net consumption (e.g. an isobaric pressure exchanger can recover ∼95% of RO brine pressure).

## Desalination Technologies (Taxonomy)

Desalination methods fall into **thermal** and **membrane/electrochemical** categories, plus emerging hybrids. The table below summarizes key metrics for major processes:

| Process | Principle | Feed Water | Recovery (%) | Energy Use (kWh/m³) | Comment |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **MSF** | Multistage flash evaporation | Seawater | ~30–50% | ~14–26 kWh/m³ (eqv)[\[3\]](https://www.desware.net/energy-requirements-desalination-processes.aspx#:~:text=100%20,to%207%20with%20Boron%20treatment) | High thermal energy (~200–300 MJ/m³); large plants; GOR~10–12 |
| **MED (TVC/MVC)** | Multi-effect distillation (TV/compressor) | Seawater | ~40–60% | ~11–28 kWh/m³ (eqv)[\[3\]](https://www.desware.net/energy-requirements-desalination-processes.aspx#:~:text=100%20,to%207%20with%20Boron%20treatment) | Lower temp than MSF; MED+mechanical or thermo-compression enhances recovery |
| **MVC/Vapor Compression** | Mechanical vapor compression (compressor or ejector) | Seawater/Brackish | ~40–60% | ~7–12 kWh/m³ (thermal)[\[3\]](https://www.desware.net/energy-requirements-desalination-processes.aspx#:~:text=100%20,to%207%20with%20Boron%20treatment) | Often single-stage; smaller scale; electrical compressor replaces steam |
| **SWRO** | High-pressure reverse osmosis | Seawater (35,000 mg/L) | ~35–50% | ~2.5–6 kWh/m³[\[2\]](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/wired-for-water-how-electrification-is-transforming-desalination#:~:text=Thermal%20plants%20are%20highly%20energy,full%20car%20tank%20of%20gas) | Most common; requires anti-scaling and energy recovery; large plants |
| **BWRO** | RO (low pressure) | Brackish (500–15,000 mg/L) | ~60–90% | ~0.5–3 kWh/m³ | Lower pressure (10–30 bar); high recovery; sometimes open membrane process |
| **ED/EDR** | Electrodialysis (reversal) | Brackish/MW (1,000–10,000 mg/L) | ~70–90% | ~2–6 kWh/m³ | Very effective for lower salinity; used in niche or high-purity needs |
| **MD** | Membrane Distillation | Seawater/Brine | ~80–90% | ~5–20 kWh/m³ (thermal) | Uses low-grade heat; small scale; good for high-salinity brines |
| **FO** | Forward Osmosis (draw solution) | Seawater/Brackish | ~30–50% | Theoretical low (requires draw regeneration) | Research stage; potential low-energy if draw solution recovery is efficient |
| **CDI** | Capacitive Deionization | Brackish (\<5,000 mg/L) | ~70–90% | ~0.5–2 kWh/m³ | Electrodes adsorb ions; best at low salinity; under development for water reuse |
| **Freeze** | Freeze separation (ice formation) | Seawater/Brackish | ~50–80% | ~15–40 kWh/m³ | Ice crystals form pure water; energy-intensive; niche (e.g. cleanup) |
| **Solar Still** | Solar evaporation-condensation | Seawater | ~20–50% | ~50–100 kWh/m³ (solar) | Passive; small output; low tech |

**SWRO Process Flow:** A typical SWRO plant consists of: (1) **Intake** – collect seawater; (2) **Pretreatment** – remove particulates/organics (screens, coagulation, DAF, media or UF filters, cartridge filters); (3) **High-Pressure Pumping** – pump feed to ~60–80 bar; (4) **RO Membrane Skids** – spiral-wound or hollow-fiber RO modules; (5) **Energy Recovery** – isobaric pressure exchangers or turbines recover brine pressure; (6) **Post-Treatment** – disinfection (chlorine, UV), remineralization (lime, alkalinity), pH adjustment; (7) **Discharge** – brine and blowdown. The mermaid flowchart below illustrates a generic SWRO train:

    graph LR
        intake(Seawater Intake) --> pretreat{Pretreatment:\\screens, DAF/UF, filters}
        pretreat --> pump[High-Pressure Pump (+ERD)]
        pump --> ro[RO Membrane Module]
        ro --> permeate(Permeate: Product Water)

        concentrate --> disposal(Brine Disposal)
        permeate --> posttreat{Post-Treatment:\\pH adjust, remineralize, disinfect}
        posttreat --> supply(Distribution / Storage)

**RO Membranes:** Spiral-wound modules (e.g. 8-inch diameter × 2.0 m long) are standard. Typical area per element is ~40–45 m². Membrane arrays are staged (series and parallel) to optimize recovery (~40–50% per pass) and salt rejection. Hollow-fiber RO is used in small or specialty plants. RO membranes are sensitive to oxidants and pH extremes; pretreatment must remove free chlorine (dechlorination) and control scalants. **Energy Recovery Devices (ERD):** Modern plants recoup ~50–80% of feed pressure from the brine via isobaric exchangers (e.g. **PX** pressure exchangers, **turbochargers**). These cut pumping energy by ~50–70%. Efficiency of state-of-art ERDs can exceed 95%.

**Thermal Systems (MSF/MED):** In MSF, heated seawater flashes to steam in a series of low-pressure stages. Condensate is collected as product. MED uses multiple “effects” where flashing heat drives the next stage under vacuum. TVC (thermal vapor compression) uses steam ejectors to compress vapor; MVC uses mechanical compressors (electrical). Heat is supplied by steam boilers or waste heat; feedwater is heated and then sprayed or cascaded to flash. Typical MSF/MED plants use titanium condenser tubes and high-grade materials to resist corrosion.

**Emerging/Hybrid:** Hybrid systems combine processes (e.g. RO+MED in series) to exploit waste heat. Brine concentrators (mechanical vapor-compression evaporators) or crystallizers can recover water from RO reject to approach Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD). These are energy-intensive and used in niche (e.g. refinery brines). Forward osmosis and graphene membranes are on the horizon but not yet commercial at large scale.

**Process Flow Diagrams:** In addition to the SWRO flow above, thermal plants have multi-effect heat-exchange diagrams, and ED systems have stacks of membranes between electrodes. Due to space limits, full PFDs are not shown, but engineers should prepare detailed P&IDs and flow schematics for each chosen technology during design.

## Design Components and Specifications

A desalination plant integrates many units. Key components include:

- **Intake:** Open-ocean intakes (offshore pipelines with screens) or subsurface intakes (beach wells, slant wells, infiltration galleries)[\[31\]](https://watereuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Intake_White_Paper.pdf#:~:text=and%20with%20minimal%20impact%20on,wells%2C%20slant%20wells%20and%20infiltration). Open intakes are simpler but require robust screening to minimize impingement (e.g. wedge-wire or mesh screens, fish diversion). Subsurface intakes naturally filter water, yielding very low turbidity feed[\[32\]](https://watereuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Intake_White_Paper.pdf#:~:text=Seawater%20collected%20by%20subsurface%20intakes,lower%20salinity%20than%20ambient%20seawater), but are site-specific (need high-permeability aquifer) and typically limited to medium capacities. Design velocity at screens is usually ≤0.3 m/s to protect marine life. Raw water may need chlorination (to prevent biofouling) followed by sodium bisulfite dechlorination.

- **Pre-Treatment:** Multiple stages to protect membranes. Typical flow: **coarse screening** (seawater drum or vertical traveling screens) → **sedimentation/DAF** (for algae, oil) → **coagulation & flocculation** (added coagulant e.g. ferric chloride 0.1–3 mg/L[\[33\]](https://desalination-delft.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Tabatabai-2014-Coagulation.pdf#:~:text=in%20flotation%20and%20as%20a,backwashable%20fouling)) → **dual-media filters** or **ultrafiltration (UF)** membranes → **microfiltration (MF)** → **fine cartridge filters (5–1 µm)**. UF pretreatment is increasingly used (especially in Gulf plants) as it reliably removes particulates and pathogens[\[34\]](https://desalination-delft.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Tabatabai-2014-Coagulation.pdf#:~:text=industry%20to%20DAF%20as%20part,Although%20the). DAF units are widely used ahead of media filters to remove algal blooms (DAF can remove 90–99% of algae[\[35\]](https://desalination-delft.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Tabatabai-2014-Coagulation.pdf#:~:text=%282010%29%20reported%2090,%282008%29%20reports)). Coagulants and polymer aids enhance settleability. All pretreatment filtrate typically goes to waste (backwash, filter brine). Common chemicals: ferric chloride, polyaluminum chloride, organic flocculants. pH adjustment is sometimes needed for optimal coagulation. Pretreatment also controls scale/organics: typical antiscalant dose is 2–5 mg/L[\[36\]](https://www.kuritaamerica.com/PDFs/Avista%20Antiscalant%20Technical%20Guide_KAI.pdf#:~:text=with%20one%20as%20a%20standby,incorporate%20into%20growing%20crystal%20structures), and acid (HCl) or CO₂ may be added to reduce pH hardness.

- **High-Pressure Pump:** Delivers feedwater to RO trains. Specifications: For SWRO, often centrifugal horizontal multistage pumps made of duplex stainless or composite; must handle ~60–80 bar. Motor-drive efficiency ~90%, pump efficiency ~80%. For our example (10,000 m³/day SWRO), we estimated a ~0.9–1.0 MW pump at 60 bar (with about 925 kW input) for ~0.12 m³/s[\[2\]](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/wired-for-water-how-electrification-is-transforming-desalination#:~:text=Thermal%20plants%20are%20highly%20energy,full%20car%20tank%20of%20gas). Pumps include seal flush and monitoring (vibration, pressure). For BWRO, pumps run at ~20–30 bar and ~10–50 kW (e.g. 30 kW for 1,000 m³/d at 20 bar).

- **Energy Recovery Device:** E.g. isobaric pressure exchanger (PX) or Pelton turbine. Recovers brine pressure; typical efficiency 85–96%. Essential for SWRO economics. e.g. **PX units** by Energy Recovery Inc or Alfo (Germany) are common; **Turbochargers** (brine-driven turbines) by Flowserve/Venture.

- **RO Membranes and Modules:** Spiral-wound elements (Dow FilmTec, Toray, Hydranautics, LG, etc.) or hollow-fiber modules. SWRO elements (8″ or 4″ diameter) often have ~40–50 m² area each. Modules are arranged 6–8 in series per pressure vessel. BWRO may use 4″-6″ elements. Modules have pressure vessels (fiberglass, stainless) rated to design pressure. Membrane specifications: Typical SWRO membrane can produce ~40 LMH (L/m²h) at 55 bar feed with ~99.5% NaCl rejection. Manufacturers’ datasheets provide limiting pressures, permeate/flux curves, cleaning procedures.

- **Heat Exchangers and Boilers (Thermal Plants):** MED/MSF require shell-and-tube heat exchangers (brass or titanium tubes) for feed heating and condensing. Boilers or waste-heat steam generators supply steam (often \>= 2 bar g). Vacuum ejectors or steam jets (TVC) and compressors (MVC) also require specialized pumps. Mechanical and electrical equipment must handle corrosive steam and high vacuum (typically 30–40 kPa abs).

- **Brine Concentrators (for ZLD):** If zero liquid discharge is needed, mechanical vapor-compression crystallizers or spray dryers are used. These are essentially small thermal evaporators for the RO brine, concentrating salts to solid.

- **Post-Treatment:** Desalinated water is typically very pure and corrosive. **Re-mineralization:** Addition of lime (Ca(OH)₂) or calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) to adjust hardness and alkalinity. **pH Adjustment:** Often using CO₂ or Ca(OH)₂. **Disinfection:** Final disinfectants (e.g. chloramine, UV) may be applied to prevent regrowth. If product is potable, it must meet WHO/EU/US water standards (conductivity, minerals). For irrigation or industrial, less stringent. Sometimes blending with other supplies is done to meet taste standards (WHO recommends blending to ensure Ca/Mg levels).

- **Corrosion Control & Materials:** High-chloride water is aggressive. Material selection: FRP, PVC/HDPE piping for brine lines; duplex stainless steel (SS 2205) or titanium for pressure exchangers and heat exchangers; carbon steel (with lining) or stainless for structural. Cathodic protection for underground steel. Dosing of corrosion inhibitors (e.g. phosphonates) is rare in seawater systems except in cooling duties. All wetted parts are designed for marine chemistry (chloride, biofouling).

- **Instrumentation & Control:** Sensors for flow, pressure, temperature, conductivity (feed, permeate, reject), pH, ORP, turbidity, and level (tanks). Online analyzers for organics or ammonia may be used. Automated control of pumps, valves, dosing, blowdown, and cleaning. Modern plants use SCADA systems with remote monitoring. Critical alarms: high differential pressure (membrane fouling), low/high salinity, pump failure, chemical low-levels, etc.

- **Layout:** Plants can be **modular** (skid-mounted RO trains in containers) or **centralized** (pipe galleries, buildings). Large plants use custom-built filter and chemical dosing buildings plus mechanical rooms. Containerized BWRO are common for small units (500–5000 m³/day). Typical plant is on a concrete slab near the shore, with intake and outfall pipelines.

## Sizing Example Calculations

**Case 1: 10,000 m³/day Seawater RO.** Assume 50% recovery, feed salinity ~35,000 mg/L (Ω=~26 bar). Required feed ≈20,000 m³/day (0.232 m³/s). With a design flux of ~20 LMH (0.02 m³/m²h), the membrane area needed ≈10,400 m² (flow/flux)[\[2\]](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/wired-for-water-how-electrification-is-transforming-desalination#:~:text=Thermal%20plants%20are%20highly%20energy,full%20car%20tank%20of%20gas). Using 8″ elements (~40 m² each), this implies ~260 modules (e.g. 13 trains × 20 vessels × 1 module). Feed pressure ~60 bar is typical, yielding permeate at 59 bar→ambient. Pumping power can be estimated: Power ≈ ρgQΔP/η ≈ (1000 kg/m³·9.81·0.116 m³/s·6×10^6 Pa)/(0.75) ≈ 926 kW (approx 1 MW)[\[2\]](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/wired-for-water-how-electrification-is-transforming-desalination#:~:text=Thermal%20plants%20are%20highly%20energy,full%20car%20tank%20of%20gas). Recovery 50% yields 10,000 m³/day product and 10,000 m³/day brine. Pretreatment must handle the full 20,000 m³/day flow; e.g. large DAF/multimedia filters with 1.0–2.0 m/s loading, followed by 1–5 µm cartridges at 416 m³/h each.

**Case 2: 1,000 m³/day Brackish RO.** Assume feed TDS ~2,000 mg/L (osmotic ~5–7 bar), desired product ~1,000 m³ (0.0116 m³/s) at 80% recovery. Feed ~1,250 m³/d. At 20 bar design pressure and flux 20 LMH, area ≈1,700 m². Pumping ~31 kW (0.03 MW). Membrane area corresponds to ~42 modules (e.g. 3 trains × 14 vessels × 1 element). Pretreatment can be simpler (e.g. cartridge filters only) due to low turbidity typical of brackish sources.

*(Detailed computations of pump power and membrane count are design examples; actual designs use manufacturer performance curves and safety margins.)*

## Environmental Impacts and Brine Disposal

Desalination impacts must be mitigated through design and management:

- **Intake Impacts:** Open-ocean intakes can impinge/entrain marine organisms. Best practice uses coarse trash racks (wide spacing) and fine barrier screens or velocity caps. Low intake velocity (\<0.3 m/s) and fish-friendly screens minimize mortality. Some plants use subsurface intakes to virtually eliminate impingement[\[37\]](https://watereuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Intake_White_Paper.pdf#:~:text=This%20white%20paper%20presents%20an,scale%20desalination).

- **Brine Discharge:** Concentrated brine (often ~1.5–2× seawater salinity) is toxic if uncontrolled. A UNEP report warns that undiluted discharge forms a dense plume that can *“degrade coastal and marine ecosystems”*[\[6\]](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/five-things-know-about-desalination#:~:text=3,support%C2%A0%2050%20Sustainable%20Development%20Goal). Mitigation methods:

- **Diffuser systems:** Multi-port diffusers dilute brine in seawater mixing zones (design to achieve \<2× ambient salinity at edge of mixing zone).

- **Deep-well injection:** feasible for brackish concentrate in permeable formations (e.g. Florida and Persian Gulf aquifers).

- **Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD):** Brine concentrators that crystallize salts can eliminate liquid effluent (currently high-energy, used rarely).

- **Alternative uses:** Some facilities combine brine with cooling water or use solar ponds to extract salt. Resource recovery (salt, Mg, Li) is under research[\[38\]](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/five-things-know-about-desalination#:~:text=are%20key%20to%20support%C2%A0Sustainable%20Development,brine%2C%20according%20to%20one%20study). For example, lithium extraction from brine is of interest for battery minerals.

- **Chemicals:** Pretreatment chemicals (e.g. chlorine, ferric chloride, antiscalants) can harm biota if discharged. All chemical wastes (filter backwash, membrane cleaning waste) must be neutralized or diluted. Disposal of chlorinated brine requires dechlorination or UV to remove halogens.

- **Energy/Emissions:** Thermal desalination often burns fossil fuels (natural gas, oil) producing CO₂. RO plants use electricity (often grid power). Moving to renewable energy (PV, wind) reduces CO₂ footprint, an active global trend[\[39\]](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/five-things-know-about-desalination#:~:text=1,litre%20of%20potable%20water%20produced)[\[40\]](https://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/migrated_files/documents/atoms/files/eyl-mazzega_cassignol_desalination_us_2022.pdf#:~:text=Israel%E2%80%99s%20Ministry%20of%20Finance,avoid%20Hutchinson%20Water%20International%2C%20a).

- **Environmental Assessment:** Any new plant usually requires an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) under local law. Key issues are:

- Marine ecosystem effects (intake, discharge).

- Social effects (land use, aesthetic).

- Cumulative impacts (multiple plants).

- Mitigation (seasonal shutdowns, monitoring programs).

Major guidelines: US EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) sets standards for cooling water intake and brine discharge. The EU requires EIA under the Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy. In the GCC (Gulf), governments have specific regulations (e.g. Saudi Standard SFDA 8657) and often permit desalination on power plant sites. **Health and Safety:** Desalination plants must follow industrial safety standards. Key hazards include high-pressure systems (risk of rupture, injury from leaks), high-voltage equipment, chemical handling (corrosives, chlorinators), confined space (tanks), slip/fall (wet floors), and noise[\[41\]](https://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/article/10.11648/j.ie.20180201.11#:~:text=while%20assessing%20the%20risk%20and,and%20safety%20instructions%20to%20the). A risk assessment for an RO plant found the most common hazards are *“working at height, working inside confined spaces or under water, exposure to noise, contacting with uncovered rotating equipment, electricity, high pressurized fluid and fire”*[\[41\]](https://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/article/10.11648/j.ie.20180201.11#:~:text=while%20assessing%20the%20risk%20and,and%20safety%20instructions%20to%20the). Mitigations: enclosed pump skids, pressure relief valves, lockout/tagout procedures, personal protective equipment, emergency showers/eyewash, and fire suppression.

## Permitting and Regulatory Frameworks

- **United States:** Permitting involves EPA (Clean Water Act 316(b) for intakes, NPDES for discharges) and state agencies (coastal zone management, fish & wildlife). A federal law (Saline Water Act of 1952) encouraged research but modern projects also require NEPA environmental review (EIS or EA). For example, Florida’s SWRO plants must meet the 30th update of the Florida WMD Chapter 62-610, specifying intake velocities and diffuser designs.

- **European Union:** New plants follow the EIA Directive 2011/92/EU and Water Framework Directive for effluent quality. The EU Drinking Water Directive (2020/2184) and WHO guidelines[\[42\]](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-HSE-WSH-11.03#:~:text=Advances%20in%20membrane%20technology%20have,water%20produced%20with%20this%20technology) influence post-treatment (e.g. boron limits). The EU Bathing Water Directive can affect coastal discharges if near recreational areas.

- **Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC):** GCC countries (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, etc.) heavily subsidize desalination as strategic infrastructure. National utility standards cover intake and discharge (often based on U.S./EU models). Many GCC projects are structured as build-own-operate (BOO) or BOOT contracts, with plant specifications defined by government water agencies. Environmental regulation is strictest in international projects (e.g. UAE Environ. Agency guidelines).

- **Health (WHO):** The WHO has published “Safe Drinking-Water from Desalination” (2011) guidance focusing on managing chemical (e.g. boron, bromide) and microbial risks[\[42\]](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-HSE-WSH-11.03#:~:text=Advances%20in%20membrane%20technology%20have,water%20produced%20with%20this%20technology). Key points: ensure residual disinfection, blend remineralized water, and monitor trace elements. The WHO drinking-water standards provide reference values for any contaminant of concern (e.g. Boron 2.4 mg/L).

## Procurement, Economics, and Finance

- **Vendors:** Desalination is a specialized field. Major engineering firms: Veolia Water Technologies (Degrémont), SUEZ (Aqualia/Westmont), IDE Technologies, Acciona Agua, Doosan (formerly Doosan Hydro), Abengoa, Hyflux, and global EPCs (Badger, IDA member companies). Membrane suppliers include DuPont Water Solutions (formerly Dow), Hydranautics, Toray, LG Chem, TriSep. Equipment: high-pressure pump makers (Grundfos, Flowserve, Sulzer), ERD makers (Energy Recovery Inc, Flotech, GEA), filters (Veolia, Evoqua), chemicals (Kemira, Solenis). Membrane unit costs are roughly \$50–100/m², pumps ~\$100–500/kW, ERDs ~\$200–400/kW equivalent.

- **Lead Times:** Key long-lead items include RO membranes (3–9 months) and custom steel tanks/vessels (6–12 months). Electrical and control panels (4–8 months). Overall construction of a 10–100 ML/day plant typically takes 18–36 months after permits. Procurement may be via competitive tender; large projects are often funded by international consortium bids.

- **CapEx and Lifecycle Cost:** Typical CapEx (waterworks only) is ~\$0.7–1.2 million per 1000 m³/day capacity[\[8\]](https://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/migrated_files/documents/atoms/files/eyl-mazzega_cassignol_desalination_us_2022.pdf#:~:text=The%20CAPEX%20,as%20much%20energy%2C%20reducing%20OPEX) (i.e. \$700–\$1,200 per (m³/d)). As of 2022, a 200,000 m³/d plant might cost ~\$150–200 million USD. Operation costs are dominated by energy (~50–70% of OPEX), plus chemicals (5–15%), labor (5–10%), and membrane replacement (about 5–10%). For example, IFRI notes large plants can produce water for ~\$0.50/m³, while small plants may exceed \$1.25/m³[\[43\]](https://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/migrated_files/documents/atoms/files/eyl-mazzega_cassignol_desalination_us_2022.pdf#:~:text=damaging%20to%20membranes,cubic%20meter%20of%20desalinated%20water). Energy price sensitivity is high: a 1 c/kWh change shifts production cost by ~\$0.02–0.03/m³. Membrane life is typically 3–5 years[\[44\]](https://www.membrane-solutions.com/blog-How-Often-Should-RO-Membrane-Be-Replaced#:~:text=Under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20the%20typical,on%20the%20factors%20listed%20above); replacement membranes cost on the order of 20–50% of O&M per year.

- **Financing:** Many desalination plants are built under government concession or PPP models. International financial institutions (World Bank, EIB, AFD) often fund strategic projects (e.g. EIB €150M loan for Israel’s Sorek II[\[40\]](https://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/migrated_files/documents/atoms/files/eyl-mazzega_cassignol_desalination_us_2022.pdf#:~:text=Israel%E2%80%99s%20Ministry%20of%20Finance,avoid%20Hutchinson%20Water%20International%2C%20a)). Financing structures may include build–operate–transfer (BOT) or power–purchase agreements for co-located plants. Grants or low-interest loans (Green Climate Fund, etc.) may support renewable-powered desalination pilots.

## Operation, Maintenance, and Staffing

- **Staffing:** Modern plants are highly automated but require skilled operators/engineers. A 10,000–100,000 m³/d plant may have ~10–20 operations staff (one per shift) plus maintenance, laboratory, and management. Shift rotations and 24/7 coverage are typical. **Training:** Operators need RO-specific training (e.g. IDA courses), safety, and process monitoring skills.

- **Fouling/Scaling Control:** Operators monitor membrane pressure drops and permeate quality. **Scaling:** Control via antiscalants and pH adjustment. **Biofouling:** Pre-chlorination (followed by dechlorination) or UV, and periodic chlorination of pretreatment. **Fouling Indicators:** Rising differential pressure (ΔP) across membranes indicates fouling; rising permeate conductivity indicates membrane breach or insufficient stage rejection.

- **Cleaning-in-Place (CIP):** Routine CIP is scheduled (typically monthly) or triggered by ΔP. Chemistry: acid (HCl or citric) to remove inorganic scale; alkaline/oxidant (NaOH + NaOCl) to remove organics/Biofilm[\[45\]](https://desalination-delft.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Tabatabai-2014-Coagulation.pdf#:~:text=Cleaning%20of%20MF%2FUF%20membranes%20requires,WHO%2C%202007). Membranes may also receive daily or weekly osmotic backwashes. UF/MF pretreatment membranes require frequent cleaning (sometimes 1–2× daily CIP[\[46\]](https://desalination-delft.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Tabatabai-2014-Coagulation.pdf#:~:text=%28WHO%2C%202007%29,applied%20by%20different%20plant%20operators)).

- **Maintenance:** Filters (sand, UF) are backwashed continuously or nightly; media replacement ~1–3 years. RO modules are replaced every 3–7 years (depending on fouling and quality)[\[44\]](https://www.membrane-solutions.com/blog-How-Often-Should-RO-Membrane-Be-Replaced#:~:text=Under%20ideal%20conditions%2C%20the%20typical,on%20the%20factors%20listed%20above). Pumps and motors follow manufacturer schedules (oil change, seal inspection). Chemical dosing systems require reagent checks and calibration.

- **Monitoring:** Key parameters: product TDS/SDI, stage pressures, flow rates, water chemistry. SCADA logs trends. On-line sensors (pH, ORP, turbidity, corrosion potential) help anticipate issues. Laboratory tests (mAlk, hardness, silica, SDI, FAC) are performed weekly. Safety: gas (chlorine, H₂S) detectors if chemicals are used.

- **Troubleshooting:** High salinity breakthrough usually means membrane failure or misoperation. High ΔP suggests particulate fouling (maybe pretreatment failure). Sudden flow drop hints at pump or ERD issue. Operators follow SOPs (e.g. isolate sections, perform CIP, adjust chemical dosing). Vendor support often includes remote monitoring (many suppliers now offer digital services).

## Site Selection and Layout

Choosing a site involves:  
- **Water Source:** Proximity to adequate saline or brackish feed. Coastal sites with deep water (to minimize sediment/biota intake) are ideal. For brackish water, proximity to aquifers or surface discharge is needed.  
- **Energy and Infrastructure:** Access to electricity (high-voltage line, potential for on-site power). Gas or steam (for thermal plants). Transportation access for construction (port/road).  
- **Geology:** Avoid fault zones; for subsurface intakes, need high-permeability sand layers[\[47\]](https://watereuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Intake_White_Paper.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L312%20constructing%20subsurface,depth%20of%20at%20least%2045). Soil stability for heavy equipment.  
- **Land:** Sufficient area for intake/outfall pipelines, treatment buildings, storage tanks, future expansion. Typically tens of thousands of m² for a large plant.  
- **Environment:** Avoid sensitive habitats (coral reefs, fisheries) near intake or outfall. Bathymetry: intake usually 5–20 m deep offshore. Outfall must ensure brine dispersal (often deeper or in strong currents).  
- **Security:** Coastal plants must consider storm surge, tsunami risk, and in some regions (e.g. Middle East) strategic security (as recent conflicts showed desal plants can be targeted[\[48\]](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/wired-for-water-how-electrification-is-transforming-desalination#:~:text=Following%20the%20outbreak%20of%20hostilities,Some%20authorities%20in%20the)).

## Environmental Impact Assessment

An EIA for a desalination plant typically covers: - **Marine Ecology:** Assess benthic habitat, fish, coral; model intake entrainment impacts. Mitigation: wedge-wire screens, slow intake, seasonal closure if needed. - **Water Quality:** Brine chemistry (salinity, temp) and fate. Modeling of plume; ensuring mixing meets water-quality criteria. Monitoring plan for salt and chemical concentrations. - **Emissions:** For thermal plants, quantify CO₂, NOₓ. Include pipeline and pump emissions. - **Marine Life:** Noise/vibration (from intake pumps or compressors). - **Social:** Effects on fisheries, tourism, wetlands. - **Cumulative:** Interaction with other coastal infrastructure.

Regulations require detailed baseline studies (e.g. coral surveys) and stakeholder engagement (fishing communities, tourism boards). Some countries mandate a desalination-specific EIA (e.g. California’s “Siting and Streamlining” guide[\[49\]](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/ocean/desalination/docs/desal-siting-streamlining-report-dec2023.pdf#:~:text=,include%20the%20most%20detailed)).

## Future Trends

Desalination R&D continues to focus on reducing energy and environmental footprint: - **Advanced Membranes:** Research on graphene, aquaporin, biomimetic membranes aims to increase permeability and selectivity, potentially lowering pressure needs. Thin-film polyamide improvements and anti-fouling coatings are incremental advances.  
- **Energy Recovery:** Innovations in ultra-efficient ERDs (e.g. interface exchangers, adiabatic chambers) push toward minimizing electrical use. Coupling desalination with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) to use waste heat is under field trials.  
- **Renewable Integration:** Solar-powered RO (photovoltaic directly powering pumps) is increasingly feasible as PV costs drop. Wind-powered RO is suitable in windy coasts (e.g. hybrid wind–battery–RO projects). Solar stills and solar-thermal MED pilot plants exist for remote islands. Desalination powered by geothermal or waste heat from industry (cogeneration) is also a trend.  
- **Resource Recovery:** Brine can be a source of minerals (salt, Mg, Li, gypsum). Pilot projects extract minerals (e.g. lithium extraction plants in the U.S. and Australia). Extracted products can offset costs. Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) processes are being refined (though currently energy-intensive).  
- **Decentralized/Mobile Systems:** Containerized or skid-mounted RO units (1–1000 m³/day) for military, disaster relief, or rural water. Research into low-energy biomass or solar steam stills for off-grid areas. Modular systems allow staged capacity growth.  
- **Digitalization:** Advanced monitoring (AI-based fault prediction), remote operation, and blockchain for water data are emerging. Sensors for real-time brine composition enable adaptive control.  
- **Novel Processes:** Laboratory and pilot FO, MD, CDI systems continue testing, but none have displaced RO yet. Capacitive deionization (CDI) may find niche in brackish water reuse. Membrane distillation (MD) is promising with low-grade heat (e.g. solar ponds).

### Implementation Roadmap and Risk Management

1.  **Feasibility:** Define water demand, available sources, and tech options. Conduct preliminary site surveys and cost estimates. Decision checkpoint: finalize process (e.g. SWRO vs MED) based on lifetime cost modeling.
2.  **Preliminary Design:** Basic engineering: layouts, preliminary PFD, financial model. Apply for initial permits/land use. Risk: feedwater quality surprises, cost overruns. Mitigation: pilot testing of feedwater pretreatment.
3.  **Detailed Design & Permitting:** Full engineering drawings, procurement specs, and EIA studies. Submit for construction permits and environmental approvals (NEPA/EIS, NPDES, etc.). Risk: permit delays or new regulatory requirements. Mitigation: engage regulators early, plan EIA with conservatively wide scope.
4.  **Financing/Procurement:** Arrange funding (debt/equity, MDB loans) and issue tenders for EPC, membranes, and equipment. Lead times: membrane supply may be 6–9 months; large pumps 6–12 months. Risk: supply chain delays, currency fluctuations. Mitigation: order long-lead items early, use fixed-price contracts.
5.  **Construction:** Civil works (intake/outfall pipelines, buildings), equipment installation. Milestone: mechanical completion. Quality: factory acceptance tests for major units; on-site commissioning tests. Risk: onsite delays (weather, labor issues), technical integration issues. Mitigation: experienced EPC contractor, buffer time in schedule.
6.  **Commissioning:** System startup, stepwise ramp-up. Perform site acceptance tests (flow, pressure, water quality). Start training operators. Risk: membrane fouling on first runs (unexpected water quality); address via extra cleaning or pretreatment tweak.
7.  **Operations & Maintenance:** After start-up, implement the O&M plan: regular CIP schedules, membrane integrity monitoring, equipment maintenance. Risk matrix example:

| Risk Factor | Likelihood/Impact | Mitigation |
|----|----|----|
| Feed quality variation (e.g. algae bloom) | High/High | Implement DAF/UF pretreatment; maintain additional capacity; monitor blooms |
| Regulatory changes | Medium/High | Keep updated; design to exceed current standards |
| Energy price volatility | Medium/High | Design high-efficiency process; long-term power contracts; renewables |
| Equipment failure (e.g. pump) | Low/High | Redundant pumps; predictive maintenance schedule |
| Membrane supply shortage | Low/Medium | Stock critical spares; multiple vendor sourcing |
| Environmental incident (brine plume) | Low/High | Conservative outfall design; brine monitoring; fish relocation if needed |

Decision points (checkpoints) should align with project phases: e.g. after feasibility (go/no-go), after 30% design (confirm major specs), before tender (finalize scope), before commissioning (performance test).
